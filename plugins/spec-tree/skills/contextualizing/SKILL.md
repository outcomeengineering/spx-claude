  NEVER work on any part of the spec tree without loading context through this skill first.

<objective>

Walk the Spec Tree from product root to a target node, deterministically collecting and reading all context: ancestor specs along the path, lower-index siblings' specs at each directory level, and all ADRs/PDRs. Emit `<SPEC_TREE_CONTEXT target="...">` marker with a structured context manifest.

This is full injection — every collected document is read into the conversation. No heuristic selection.

</objective>

<quick_start>

**PREREQUISITE**: Check for `<SPEC_TREE_FOUNDATION>` marker. If absent, invoke `/understanding` first.

Invoke with the **full path** from `spx/` to the target node:

```text
/contextualizing 21-infra.enabler/32-parser.outcome
```

**Never use bare node names** — indices are sibling-unique, not globally unique:

```text
# Wrong: ambiguous
/contextualizing 32-parser.outcome

# Right: unambiguous
/contextualizing 21-infra.enabler/32-parser.outcome
```

</quick_start>

<essential_principles>

**COMPLETE CONTEXT OR ABORT. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

- Every node along the path must have its spec file (`{slug}.md`)
- Missing spec file = ABORT with remediation guidance
- Read order: product root → ancestors → target (top-down)
- All ADRs and PDRs at all levels must be read — no skipping based on title relevance
- Lower-index siblings' specs must be read at each directory level — they constrain the target
- Test files are excluded — context is about specs and decisions, not evidence

**BOOTSTRAP MODE**: When the target path doesn't exist yet and the operation is authoring, return an empty manifest with `bootstrap=true` instead of aborting. This allows creating the first node in an empty tree.

</essential_principles>

<workflow>

<phase name="locate">

**Phase 0: Locate target node**

```bash
# Find the product file
Glob: "spx/*.product.md"

# Verify target path exists
Glob: "spx/{target-path}/*.md"
```

If the product file is missing, ABORT: "No product file found in spx/. Create one with `/authoring` first."

If the target path doesn't exist:

- If operation is `author` → return empty manifest with `bootstrap=true`
- Otherwise → ABORT: "Target path not found: {path}. Check the path or create it with `/authoring`."

Extract the path segments from product root to target. Each segment is a directory to walk.

</phase>

<phase name="product">

**Phase 1: Load product-level context**

```bash
# Read product spec
Read: spx/{product-name}.product.md

# Read product guide if present
Read: spx/CLAUDE.md  (if exists)

# Read ALL product-level ADRs and PDRs
Glob: "spx/*-*.adr.md"
Glob: "spx/*-*.pdr.md"
```

**Read EVERY file returned by the globs.** Do not filter by title. Decision records contain cross-cutting constraints that may not be obvious from the title.

**Verification**: Count files returned by globs. Count files actually read. These must match.

</phase>

<phase name="walk">

**Phase 2: Walk the tree from root to target**

For each directory along the path from product root to the target node:

**2a. Read the directory's spec file**

```bash
# The spec file is {slug}.md (no type suffix, no numeric prefix)
Read: spx/{path-to-dir}/{slug}.md
```

ABORT if the spec file is missing.

**2b. Read all ADRs and PDRs in this directory**

```bash
Glob: "spx/{path-to-dir}/*-*.adr.md"
Glob: "spx/{path-to-dir}/*-*.pdr.md"
```

**Read EVERY file returned.** Verification: glob count must equal read count.

**2c. Read all lower-index siblings' specs**

The target node has an index (e.g., `43` in `43-feature.outcome`). All sibling nodes with a lower index constrain the target and must be read.

```bash
# List all sibling directories (same parent, different from target)
Glob: "spx/{parent-path}/*-*.{enabler,outcome}/"

# For each sibling with a lower index than the target:
Read: spx/{parent-path}/{sibling-dir}/{sibling-slug}.md
```

Lower-index siblings' ADRs/PDRs are NOT read — only the sibling's spec itself. The dependency encoding means the sibling's existence constrains the target, but the sibling's internal decisions are its own concern.

**2d. Note same-index siblings (independent)**

Siblings with the same index as the target are independent — they neither constrain nor are constrained by the target. List them but do not read.

</phase>

<phase name="target">

**Phase 3: Load target node context**

```bash
# Read target spec
Read: spx/{target-path}/{slug}.md

# Read target ADRs and PDRs
Glob: "spx/{target-path}/*-*.adr.md"
Glob: "spx/{target-path}/*-*.pdr.md"

# Enumerate children (if any)
Glob: "spx/{target-path}/*-*.{enabler,outcome}/"

# Check for tests directory
Glob: "spx/{target-path}/tests/*"
```

</phase>

<phase name="summary">

**Phase 4: Emit context marker and summary**

Emit the `<SPEC_TREE_CONTEXT>` marker with all collected information:

```text
<SPEC_TREE_CONTEXT target="{full-target-path}">

Product: {product-name}
Target: {target-path} ({enabler|outcome})

Documents loaded:
  Product spec: {product-file}
  Ancestor specs: {count} read
  Lower-index sibling specs: {count} read
  ADRs: {count} found, {count} read
  PDRs: {count} found, {count} read

Hierarchy:
  {product-name}
  └── {ancestor-1} ({enabler|outcome})
      └── {ancestor-2} ({enabler|outcome})
          └── {target} ({enabler|outcome}) ← TARGET

Children: {count} ({list if any})
Tests: {exists|missing}
Lower-index siblings read: {list}
Same-index siblings (independent): {list}
Higher-index siblings (depend on target): {list}

</SPEC_TREE_CONTEXT>
```

</phase>

</workflow>

<abort_protocol>

When a required document is missing, ABORT immediately with:

1. **What's missing** — exact file path expected
2. **Why it's needed** — what context it provides
3. **How to fix** — specific remediation action

| Missing       | Remediation                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product file  | "Create with `/authoring` — every tree needs a product spec"                             |
| Ancestor spec | "Node directory exists but spec file is missing. Create `{slug}.md`"                     |
| Target spec   | "Target directory exists but spec file is missing. Create `{slug}.md` with `/authoring`" |

Do NOT proceed with partial context. The whole point of deterministic context is completeness.

</abort_protocol>

<failure_modes>

**Failure 1: Skipped ADRs/PDRs based on title relevance**

Agent globbed 12 decision records but only read 3 whose titles seemed relevant. The answer to the user's question was in one of the 9 skipped documents. The verification gate ("glob count must equal read count") prevents this.

**Failure 2: Missed lower-index siblings**

Agent walked the ancestor chain but didn't read lower-index siblings' specs. A lower-index enabler contained infrastructure the target depended on. The dependency encoding means lower-index = constraining, so they must be read.

**Failure 3: Read higher-index siblings**

Agent read ALL siblings including higher-index ones. Higher-index siblings may depend on the target but don't constrain it. Reading them wastes context window and may introduce irrelevant information.

</failure_modes>

<success_criteria>

Context loading is complete when:

- [ ] Product spec located and read
- [ ] All product-level ADRs/PDRs read (glob count = read count)
- [ ] Every ancestor along the path: spec read, ADRs/PDRs read
- [ ] Lower-index siblings' specs read at each directory level
- [ ] Target spec read
- [ ] Target ADRs/PDRs read
- [ ] Children enumerated
- [ ] Test directory status checked
- [ ] `<SPEC_TREE_CONTEXT target="...">` marker emitted with full manifest
- [ ] No ABORT conditions triggered (or appropriate error shown with remediation)
