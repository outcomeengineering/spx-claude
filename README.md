# Outcome Engineering Plugin Marketplace

A Claude Code plugin marketplace (`outcomeeng/claude`) for [Outcome Engineering](https://outcome.engineering) and [SPX](https://spx.sh) — spec-driven development with skills and commands for testing, Python and TypeScript engineering, and productivity.

## Philosophy

1. **RTFM:** Follow state-of-the-art (SOTA) model prompting guidance, such as [structured prompts based on XML tags](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags#tagging-best-practices)
2. **KILO:**: *Keep It Local and Observable,* to facilitate discovery by agents by keeping the golden source for all specifications locally within the project's Git repository

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the SPX CLI

```bash
npm install -g @outcomeeng/spx
```

SPX is the developer CLI for spec-driven development. See [@outcomeeng/spx on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@outcomeeng/spx) for details.

### 2. Add the marketplace and install plugins

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add outcomeeng/claude

# Recommended plugins
claude plugin install spec-tree@outcomeeng   # spec-driven development + commands
claude plugin install prose@outcomeeng       # writing and reviewing prose
claude plugin install claude@outcomeeng      # meta-skills for plugin development
```

### 3. Use skills and commands

**`spec-tree` — spec-driven development + commands:**

```text
> /commit                          # commit with Conventional Commits
> /handoff                         # create context handoff for next session
> /pickup                          # continue from a previous handoff
> /tdd                             # start the TDD flow
> /rtfm                            # stop ad hoc work, follow methodology
> /clarify                         # gather requirements before executing
> /testing                         # write tests driven by spec assertions
> /coding                          # TDD flow: architect, test, code + review
```

**`prose` — writing and reviewing:**

```text
> /writing-prose                   # activate prose craft for long-form text
> /reviewing-prose                 # review text for formulaic patterns
> Write a blog post about X        # Claude invokes /writing-prose automatically
```

**`claude` — plugin development:**

```text
> /creating-skills                 # create a new SKILL.md with guidance
> /auditing-skills                 # audit an existing skill for best practices
> /creating-commands               # create a new slash command
```

### Language plugins (install per project)

```bash
claude plugin install typescript@outcomeeng  # TypeScript engineering
claude plugin install python@outcomeeng      # Python engineering
```

These add language-specific skills like `/testing-typescript`, `/coding-python`, `/reviewing-typescript`, etc.

### Spec Tree framework (for spec-driven projects)

```bash
claude plugin install spec-tree@outcomeeng   # Spec Tree framework
```

### Updating plugins

```bash
# Update this marketplace
claude plugin marketplace update outcomeeng

# Or update all marketplaces
claude plugin marketplace update
```

For automatic updates, run `claude`, navigate to `/plugin marketplace`, select this marketplace, and enable `Enable auto-update`.

### core

Standalone commit workflow for projects that don't use the Spec Tree. Provides `/commit`, `/handoff`, and `/pickup` without spec-tree skills. Install `spec-tree` instead if your project has an `spx/` directory.
