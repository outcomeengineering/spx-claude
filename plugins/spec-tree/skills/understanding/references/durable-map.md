<overview>
The Spec Tree is a **durable map** — a permanent record of what the product is and does. Specs are not work items. They are not tickets. They do not move through a pipeline.

| Backlog thinking  | Durable map thinking               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Create ticket     | Create potential                   |
| Close ticket      | Realize potential (tests pass)     |
| Archive done work | Nothing moves — specs stay forever |
| Assign status     | Derive state from tests            |
| Sprint velocity   | Realization rate                   |
| Groom backlog     | Prune tree                         |

<potential_energy>

When you write a spec, you create **potential energy** in the system. The spec defines a state of the world that doesn't yet exist but should.

When tests pass, potential becomes **realized**. The spec now describes something true about the product.

When you edit a realized spec, you create new potential. The evidence no longer matches the claim. Reality needs to catch up to the new vision.

When you remove a spec, you **prune** — deciding this branch no longer serves the tree's growth. The product becomes simpler.

<atemporal_voice>

Specs state product truth. They never narrate history, never reference time, never describe a journey of discovery.

**Temporal markers to eliminate:**

| Temporal (wrong)                  | Atemporal (correct)           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "We discovered that X"            | "X ensures Y"                 |
| "X has accumulated without Y"     | "Y prevents Z"                |
| "We need to address"              | "[Product] provides"          |
| "Currently, the system"           | "[Product] [does thing]"      |
| "After investigating, we decided" | "[Decision] governs [scope]"  |
| "This was introduced because"     | "[Feature] enables [outcome]" |
| "Over time, X became"             | "X is [state]"                |

**Test:** Read any sentence aloud. If it would sound wrong after the work is done, it's temporal.

**Why it matters:** Temporal language creates documents that rot. "We currently need X" becomes false the moment X is delivered, but the document still says "we need" it. Atemporal language makes documents permanent statements — they're either true about the product or they should be removed.

<prohibited_operations>

These operations do not exist in the Spec Tree:

- **Close** a spec — Specs describe product truth. Truth isn't closed.
- **Move** a spec to "done" — There is no done directory. The spec stays where it is.
- **Archive** a spec — If it's true, it stays. If it's no longer true, prune it.
- **Assign status** — Status is derived from tests, not set by a human or agent.
- **Mark as complete** — Completion is proven by tests passing.

</prohibited_operations>

<node_states>

A node's state is derived from its spec and tests:

- **Needs work** — the spec exists but has no tests. The potential is unrealized.
- **Failing** — tests exist but don't pass. The spec and reality disagree.
- **Realized** — tests pass. The spec describes something true about the product.

Failing is a natural, healthy state. Every spec edit may cause tests to fail. This is the system working as designed — not a problem to fix urgently.

<common_agent_mistakes>

| Agent impulse                  | Correct response                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Task complete, closing story" | Nothing to close. If tests pass, the node is realized.   |
| "Moving to done"               | There is no done. The spec stays where it is.            |
| "Archiving completed work"     | Do not archive. The spec is the permanent record.        |
| "Setting status to complete"   | Do not set status. Run tests — passing tests = realized. |
| "This spec is outdated"        | Either it's still true (keep it) or prune it.            |
| "Creating a new ticket for X"  | Create or edit a spec. Specs are not tickets.            |
