<objective>

Adversarial code review through comprehension. Find design flaws that automated tools cannot catch. Produce a structured verdict -- not code changes.

This skill is read-only. It produces verdicts, not commits or fixes.

**Test evidence quality is audited by `/auditing-python-tests`.** This skill audits implementation code, not test code. If test files are in scope, delegate to `/auditing-python-tests`.

</objective>

<quick_start>

1. Read `/testing` for methodology + `/testing-python` for Python patterns
2. Load project config: `CLAUDE.md`, `pyproject.toml` (Phase 0)
3. Run automated gates -- project validation command (Phase 1, blocking)
4. Run tests -- verify all pass (Phase 2, blocking)
5. **Comprehend every function** -- predict, verify, investigate (Phase 3)
6. Check ADR/PDR compliance (Phase 4)
7. Produce structured verdict: APPROVED or REJECTED

</quick_start>

<essential_principles>

**Trust automated gates, then comprehend.**

Phases 1-2 are mechanical prerequisites. If they fail, stop -- REJECTED. If they pass, do NOT re-check what linters and tests already verified. Your time is for Phase 3.

**Comprehension is the core value.**

Automated tools catch syntax errors, type mismatches, and lint violations. You catch: functions that do more than their name says, dead parameters required by no Protocol, IO tangled with logic, and designs that will break under change. The predict/verify protocol (Phase 3) is how you find these.

**Test evidence is not your concern.**

`/auditing-python-tests` evaluates whether tests provide genuine evidence using the 4-property model (coupling, falsifiability, alignment, coverage). This skill verifies tests PASS, not whether they have evidentiary value. Do not duplicate that work.

**Binary verdict, no caveats.**

APPROVED means every concern passes. REJECTED means at least one fails. APPROVED output contains no notes, warnings, or suggestions sections.

</essential_principles>

<process>

Execute phases IN ORDER. Do not skip.

**Phase 0: Scope and Project Config**

1. Determine target files/directories
2. Read `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md` for validation commands and test runners
3. Check `pyproject.toml` for tool configurations (ruff, mypy, pytest)

**Phase 1: Automated Gates** (blocking)

Run the project's validation command. Catches everything linters handle: type annotations, naming, magic numbers, bare excepts, unused imports, security rules.

If the project lacks its own linter configs, use the reference configs in `${SKILL_DIR}/rules/`:

| File                | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `ruff_quality.toml` | Ruff linting (pycodestyle, bugbear, security)   |
| `mypy_strict.toml`  | Mypy strict type checking                       |
| `semgrep_sec.yaml`  | Semgrep security patterns (eval, pickle, shell) |

Non-zero exit = REJECTED. Do not proceed.

Do NOT manually re-check what linters catch. If the project's linters are properly configured per `/standardizing-python`, they handle type annotations, magic numbers, bare excepts, unused imports, commented-out code, modern syntax, and security rules.

**Note**: Some rules require manual verification during Phase 3 -- deep relative imports, `sys.path` manipulation, unqualified `Any`, `# type: ignore` without justification.

**Phase 2: Test Execution** (blocking)

Run the full test suite. Use the project's test runner from `CLAUDE.md`.

If tests require infrastructure (databases, Docker), attempt to provision it. Do not skip tests because infrastructure "isn't running" -- try to start it first.

ANY test failure = REJECTED. Do not proceed.

**Phase 3: Code Comprehension**

Read every file. Understand it. Question it. Do NOT skim, sample, or check boxes.

**3.1 Per-Function Protocol**

For each function/method:

1. **Read name and signature only** -- name, parameters, return type
2. **Predict** what it does in one sentence
3. **Read the body** -- validate your prediction
4. **Investigate surprises:**

| Surprise                               | What it suggests                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter never used in body           | Dead parameter -- required by Protocol, or remove |
| Does more than name says               | SRP violation or misleading name                  |
| Does less than name says               | Name overpromises or logic is incomplete          |
| Variable assigned but never read       | Dead code or unfinished logic                     |
| Code path that can never execute       | Dead branch given calling context                 |
| Return value contradicts the type hint | Logic error or wrong return type                  |

Prediction matched? Move on. Surprise? Document it with `file:line`.

**3.2 Design Evaluation**

For the codebase as a whole:

- **IO vs logic separation** -- Can core logic be tested without IO? Tangled computation and side effects need factoring.
- **Dependency injection** -- External dependencies injected via parameters or Protocol, or imported as globals?
- **Single responsibility** -- Each module/class does one thing? Each function does one thing?
- **Error quality** -- Errors include what failed and with what input?
- **Domain exceptions** -- Custom exceptions for domain errors, or everything generic `ValueError`/`RuntimeError`?

**3.3 Import Evaluation**

Evaluate import structure using the same vocabulary as `/auditing-python-tests`:

| Import pattern                                            | Classification                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `import pytest`                                           | Framework -- not reviewed       |
| `from hypothesis import given`                            | Framework -- not reviewed       |
| `import json`                                             | Stdlib -- not reviewed          |
| `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING`                        | Type-only -- erased at runtime  |
| `from product.config import parse_config`                 | Codebase (production) -- review |
| `from ..config import parse_config`                       | Codebase (relative) -- review   |
| `from product_testing.harnesses import ConfigTestHarness` | Codebase (test infra) -- review |

**Import depth rules:**

| Depth           | Example                   | Verdict                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Package import  | `from product.config ...` | OK -- preferred                  |
| 1 level         | `from ..config ...`       | Review -- truly module-internal? |
| 2+ levels       | `from ....helpers ...`    | REJECT -- use package import     |
| sys.path manip. | `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` | REJECT -- always                 |

For stable locations (`product_testing.*`, shared fixtures), package imports are mandatory.

See `${SKILL_DIR}/references/false-positive-handling.md` for application context when evaluating security and linter suppression comments.

**Phase 4: ADR/PDR Compliance**

Find applicable ADRs/PDRs in the spec hierarchy (`*.adr.md`, `*.pdr.md`). Verify each constraint is followed. Undocumented deviations = REJECTED. If the project has no spec hierarchy, this concern is N/A.

| Decision Record Constraint           | Violation Example                   | Verdict  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| "Use dependency injection" (ADR)     | Direct imports of external services | REJECTED |
| "Level 1 tests for logic" (ADR)      | Unit tests hitting network          | REJECTED |
| "No ORM" (ADR)                       | SQLAlchemy models introduced        | REJECTED |
| "Lifecycle is Draft→Published" (PDR) | Added hidden `Archived` state       | REJECTED |

</process>

<failure_modes>

These are real failures from past audits. Study them to avoid repeating them.

**Approved code that passed ruff+mypy but had a design flaw.** The auditor trusted Phase 1 output and skimmed Phase 3. The code had a function named `validate_config` that also wrote the config file -- SRP violation hidden behind a reasonable name. The predict/verify protocol would have caught it: "Given the name, I predict this validates. But the body also calls `Path.write_text()`. Surprise."

**Rejected code for a false positive.** The auditor flagged a parameter as "dead code" because it wasn't used in the function body. The parameter was required by a `CommandHandler` Protocol contract -- other implementations used it. Before flagging dead parameters, check if the function implements a Protocol.

**Tried to evaluate test evidence instead of delegating.** The auditor found `lambda cmd: (0, "", "")` in tests and spent time analyzing whether it severed coupling. That's `/auditing-python-tests`' job. This auditor should have verified tests PASS (Phase 2) and moved on to comprehending the implementation code.

**Distracted by style while missing a logic bug.** The auditor spent review time on naming conventions, import ordering, and docstring completeness. Meanwhile, a branch condition was inverted -- `if is_valid` should have been `if not is_valid`. Comprehension (understanding what the code does) must come before style. Style is the linter's job.

**Accepted code with tangled IO.** A `process_orders` function both computed order totals AND sent confirmation emails. Tests passed and types were correct. But the function was untestable without an email server -- IO and logic were tangled. The design evaluation (3.2) would have caught it: "Can core logic be tested without IO? No."
